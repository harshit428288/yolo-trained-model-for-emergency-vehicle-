🚦 AI-Powered Lane Traffic Light Control System 🚦
 Excited to share my recent project aimed at transforming urban traffic management using computer vision and real-time intelligence.
🔍 Project Overview:
 I developed a smart traffic control system that uses YOLO-based vehicle detection to count vehicles in each lane using CCTV feeds. Based on real-time traffic density, the system dynamically allocates green light timing per lane—ensuring smoother traffic flow and reduced congestion.
🚑 Emergency Vehicle Priority:
 What makes this system special is its ability to detect emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire trucks, etc.) using a custom-trained YOLOv5 model and immediately prioritize their passage by turning all other signals red—potentially saving lives during critical moments.
💻 Tech Stack Used:
YOLOv8 & YOLOv5 (for general & emergency vehicle detection)
OpenCV
Python
Google Colab (for training and testing models)
Custom dataset (Rainbow Universe)
🌐 Application Scope:
Smart cities and urban intersections
Edge AI integration with traffic cameras
Emergency vehicle routing
I’m currently exploring patent filing and real-world deployment possibilities. If you’re working in AI, computer vision, or smart city tech—let’s connect and collaborate!
